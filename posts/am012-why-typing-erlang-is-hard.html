<h1>Why Typing Erlang is Hard: Standard Erlang</h1>
<p>I heard before that Erlang and the BEAM did not pack a static type system
because their creators <em>&quot;couldn't build it&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>While building a sophisticated, reliable and scalable type checker is
absolutely not a walk in the park, building one that works is not that hard. So
if it could have been done, it's likely that it would've been done, and it
would've been hardened by the same process OTP was hardened and turned into
what it is today: a reliability gold standard.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an Erlang type-checker to really understand what is hard
about typing Erlang. I know Dialyzer exists, and its great, I just wanted to
understand from scratch.</p>
<p>It hit me that there is a split in here, that is sometimes hard to notice and
it makes a world of a difference. There is <strong>an Erlang language</strong>, called
Standard Erlang, and there is <strong>an Erlang Runtime</strong>, the BEAM. Along the same
lines as there is a Java language, and then there's the JVM.</p>
<p>Typing these 2 layers is typing 2 entirely different beasts.</p>
<p>Here I'll go over what I've learned takes to type the Standard Erlang, and what
are the thorny parts. We'll cover the runtime bits on a following essay.</p>
<p>First, lets scope what actually <em>is</em> Standard Erlang.</p>
<h2>Standard Erlang</h2>
<p>Erlang is a dynamically, strongly typed language. It includes just a little
extra over your typical functional programming language. Overall isn't <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl">that big a language</a>.</p>
<p>My eye-ball estimation is that it is about a 3rd of the size of OCaml, and
about a 5th of the size of Java.</p>
<p>Here's some Erlang:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Erlang">-module(hello_world).

-export([hi/1]).  % &lt;-- this a compiler annotation

hi(noone) -&gt; sad;
hi(Name) -&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Hello, &quot;, (Name)/binary, &quot;!&quot;&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>An Erlang program consists of a number of <code>modules</code>, each module is just a file
with a bunch of <code>functions</code> in it and a few <code>annotations</code> used to tell the
compiler what's exported, who the module author is, what a function type is
supposed to be, etc.</p>
<p>There's quite a few things you can write in Erlang that are relatively common:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals like booleans, numbers or strings</li>
<li>lists, maps, tuples, lambdas</li>
<li>ifs, try/catch, case</li>
<li>function calls and references</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there's a few things that aren't common at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>atoms, which are just constants</li>
<li>receive expressions</li>
<li>all sorts of pattern matching</li>
<li>everything is done through recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, the language expressivity comes from being rather simple. Most
problems are solved by making functions that call each other, most functions
pattern match on exactly the data they need, loops are achieved through
recursion, and we're done.</p>
<p>Exceptions are very common, since failing to pattern match will result in an
exception. For this the language supports the <code>catch</code>, and <code>try..catch..after</code>
expressions, but it is highly unidiomatic to use them.</p>
<p>The superb uptime through supervision that Erlang is known for is actually
baked into the runtime, not the language. The language itself has no notion of
processes, links, or sending messages. The only thing it does have is <em>receive</em>
expressions for <em>consuming messages</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding, lets dig into how we could type Erlang.</p>
<h2>Typing the Erlang Language</h2>
<p>Typing Standard Erlang has a few difficulties that primarily seem to arise from
its dynamic nature as a language.</p>
<p>There is a subset of the language that <em>is statically typeable</em>, and I will try
to cover this in a follow up post, but today lets look at the entire language
and how we could type the different parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions on Untagged Unions</li>
<li>Functions on Records</li>
<li>Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</li>
<li>Receive Expressions</li>
<li>Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that there are other parts of the language that are either
straightforward or not particularly friendly to static analysis, but these are
the ones I've found so far. I'll try to write and cover more in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Functions on Untagged Unions</h3>
<p>An Erlang value can have a single type but we expect that type to be known only
at runtime. This means that both the input and returning types of a function
are actually unknown <em>until</em> we run the function.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a function like <code>hi/1</code> above, calling it could actually
return a value of different types, depending on how the function was written.</p>
<p>For example, calling <code>hi(noone)</code> returns the atom <code>sad</code>. Instead, calling
<code>hi(&lt;&lt;&quot;Joe&quot;&gt;&gt;)</code> returns the string <code>&lt;&lt;&quot;Hello, Joe!&quot;&gt;&gt;</code>. The atom <code>sad</code> and the
string have different types. Calling <code>hi(0)</code> will result in an exception.</p>
<p>If we were to write down the type of this function we'd have to say something
like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">hi(atom(&quot;noone&quot;) | string) -&gt; atom(&quot;sad&quot;) | string
</code></pre>
<p>This is present in every other dynamic language: Lisp, Lua, Javascript, Python,
Ruby, Smalltalk, you name it.</p>
<p>Erlang has 2 features to help you narrow these inputs down to ones that you are
absolutely certain how to handle: pattern-matching and guards.</p>
<p>Writing a type-checker that deals with this is certainly possible, as it has
been done before in tools like <a href="flow-type">Flow</a> and <a href="typescript">TypeScript</a>,
but it certainly isn't obvious how to.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can be dealt with, we need to talk about <a href="union-types">Union
Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Union types</strong> allow us to express that a value may belong to one of many
different types at the same time. E.g, <code>1</code> is a <code>number</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>. In the same way, <code>true</code> is a <code>bool</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>.</p>
<p>We read <code>(number | bool)</code> as &quot;number or bool&quot;.</p>
<p>The key here is that the value itself doesn't have explicit information about
which type from the union it actually belongs to, and we're bound to find this
out through <em>refinements</em>.</p>
<p>We can do these refinements in 2 ways through the use of guards and pattern
matching.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Through the use of guards</strong> we can refine the actual type of a value into a
single type. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">left_pad(A, B) when is_binary(A) -&gt; &lt;&lt;(A)/binary, (B)/binary&gt;&gt;;
left_pad(A, B) when is_number(A) -&gt; left_pad(binary:copy(&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;&gt;, A), B).
</code></pre>
<p>This function is has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">left_pad( string | number, string ) -&gt; string
</code></pre>
<p>But it is thanks to the guards <code>is_binary/1</code> and <code>is_number/1</code> that we <em>refine</em>
the type of the inputs to be just <code>string</code> or just <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to say that <code>binary:copy(&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;&gt;, A)</code> is safe, because
at that point we know that <code>is_number(A)</code> was true, and so <code>A</code>'s type has been
refined from <code>string | number</code> to just <code>number</code>. Otherwise the guard would have
been false.</p>
<p>However, we can't use any function as a guard. We must use only built-in
functions that already come with Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to write arbitrary refinement logic, which makes the
approach rather limited.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Through pattern matching</strong> we can do something very similar, and establish
our expectations of the values. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">count(A=[_|_]) -&gt; count(A, 0).

count([], C) -&gt; C;
count([_|T]) -&gt; count(T, C+1).
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are guaranteed that if our function pattern matches, then <code>A</code>
will be a list.</p>
<p>We don't really know what the list elements are, but of course we can try and
continue pattern matching and using guards until we refine it &quot;enough&quot;.</p>
<p>These two approaches, while composable, have the unfortunate property that they
don't generalize to all kinds of data. They should work well tho for: atoms,
literals, and anything that there is a guard available for.</p>
<p>Anything where our data is one of type <em>or</em> another, would fall into this
category.</p>
<p>Maps, tuples, and records can work with this, but it doesn't scale very well.
You essentially have to add the new map/tuple/record name to the union every
time you want it supported. Even if you need a single field out of them.</p>
<p>In the next section we'll see a different approach for dealing with this data
that scales much better.</p>
<h3>2. Functions on Records</h3>
<p>When working with functions that take as inputs many values packed into one, be
it with records, maps, or tuples, we're faced with a different issue: we don't
care what the input type is <em>as long as it has what we need in it</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have two possible maps that share some things, both of them
could be thought of as their own separate type, and these 2 types would have
something in common.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">% this has type 'character'
Character = #{ name =&gt; &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;, play =&gt; &quot;Hamilton&quot; }.

% this has type 'performer'
Performer = #{ name =&gt; &quot;Lin-Manuel Miranda&quot; }.
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make a function to get the name of a Performer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">name(#{ name := Name }) -&gt; Name.
</code></pre>
<p>and we give it a type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">name(performer) -&gt; string.
</code></pre>
<p>Would we expect this function to work on Characters?</p>
<p>My answer is yes, since Characters also have a <code>name</code> fields.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd say that it will work just fine for any map <em>as long as it has a
name key that is a string</em>.</p>
<p>So the type of our function isn't quite <code>(character | performer)</code>. It actually
is &quot;Any map as long as it has a name key that is a string&quot;. I'll use this
notation for that: <code>#{ name }</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">name(#{ name : A }) -&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>Some type-systems support this with Structural Subtyping, some others use Row
Polymorphism. The main difference isn't obvious in this getter function, but
becomes obvious in the next one, a setter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">with_name(Name, M=#{ name := _ }) -&gt; M#{ name =&gt; Name }.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The structural subtyping approach</strong> would say that whatever you put in, it is
now known to only have a <code>name</code> key. So all your other keys have disappeared
(to the eyes of the type-system) and if you want to recover them you have to do
some sort of casting. This is due to a subtyping behavior called <em>subsumption</em>
and its the way that TypeScript handles this.</p>
<p><strong>The row polymorphic approach</strong> has no information loss, and instead carries
around the rest of the fields that <code>M</code> had. This is how OCaml and PureScript
handles this. In PureScript this works for record types and in OCaml this is
implemented for the object-oriented system.</p>
<p>Either one of this approaches extends to the case where we use <em>all of the
fields</em> of the input tuple, record, or map.</p>
<h3>3. Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</h3>
<p>Whenever a function takes in a parameter, or returns a result that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">{tag, Value}
</code></pre>
<p>We are in the presence of a <em>tagged union</em>, or <em>variant</em>.</p>
<p>This is an easier thing to deal with than #1, because now we have more
information to know what is the actual type of the value: the tag.</p>
<p>For example, take this function that may or may not succeed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">work(ok) -&gt; {ok, success};
work(not_ok) -&gt; {error, &lt;&lt;&quot;something went wrong&quot;&gt;&gt;}.
</code></pre>
<p>We can tell that the signature of this function is going to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">work( atom(&quot;ok&quot;) | atom(&quot;not_ok&quot;) ) -&gt; { atom(&quot;ok&quot;), atom(&quot;success&quot;) }
                                     | { atom(&quot;error&quot;), string } 
</code></pre>
<p>Which now has these constant values (<code>ok</code>, <code>error</code>) on the left side of the
tuple, which we can use to further narrow down what the expected types should
be.</p>
<p>This is a well established pattern in the Erlang ecosystem, where most
functions that can fail return this result tuples with either an <code>ok</code> or an
<code>error</code> tag.</p>
<p>To be fair, this still suffers from the problems of #1. We can make a function
that returns an ok-tagged value that is an untagged union of types as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">work(ok) -&gt; {ok, go_on};
work(done) -&gt; {ok, &lt;&lt;&quot;great job!&quot;&gt;&gt;};
work(not_ok) -&gt; {error, &lt;&lt;&quot;something went wrong&quot;&gt;&gt;}.
</code></pre>
<p>The signature of this function would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">work(In) -&gt; { atom(&quot;ok&quot;), atom(&quot;go_on&quot;) | string }
          | { atom(&quot;error&quot;), string } 
</code></pre>
<p>If you get an <code>{ok, Value}</code>, typing <code>Value</code> has the exact same issues we discussed above.</p>
<p>However, this pattern helps us in typing things because we can always tag our
data all the way down:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">work(ok) -&gt; {ok, go_on};
work(done) -&gt; {ok, {message, &lt;&lt;&quot;great job!&quot;&gt;&gt;}};
work(not_ok) -&gt; {error, &lt;&lt;&quot;something went wrong&quot;&gt;&gt;}.
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a little more verbose, but a lot more amenable to type-checking too,
since the type-checker can associate a specific tag with a specific type.</p>
<h3>4. Receive Expressions</h3>
<p>There is an asymmetry in the language: at the language level we can only
receive messages. There is no special constructs for sending messages. To send
a message we just use the <code>erlang:send/2</code> function, or its operator version
<code>!</code>.</p>
<p>So in any function, when we encounter a <code>receive</code> expression we are really
saying 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here be <strong>side-inputs</strong> — this function will receive a value that is
not a direct argument, and it can use it as if it was one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a timeout (the <code>after</code> part), then there is also a <strong>deadline</strong>.
Literally, since if this was a process, it'd be killed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't bother too much with the deadline right now, but we'll look into these
side-inputs we receive as messages. Here's an example of this expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">adder() -&gt; receive {X, Y} -&gt; X + Y end.
</code></pre>
<p>We are very interested in the pattern matching that just happened up there,
since that pattern matching essentially tells us what messages we can receive.</p>
<p>So much so, that we could think of this <code>receive</code> expression as a function
built into the language that we can call with a function of our own.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">adder() -&gt; receive      {X, Y}  -&gt; X + Y end .
adder() -&gt; receive(fun ({X, Y}) -&gt; X + Y end).
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can analyze this internal function in the same ways we analyzed
points 1, 2, and 3 above.</p>
<p>This reframing of receive expressions was actually key for the type-checker I'm
writing to be able to understand what messages a process could receive, if we
used the <code>adder/0</code> to start it.</p>
<p>So that's how we can work with these <code>receive</code> expressions.</p>
<h3>5. Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</h3>
<p>Another beast entirely is the dynamic parts of the language that allow us to
make decisions at runtime about what code to run, through special syntax.</p>
<p>Erlang supports specifying what module, and what function you want to call in
that module, completely dynamically.</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">M = hello.
F = world.
M:F() =:= hello:world().
</code></pre>
<p>But how can we tell what type will <code>M:F()</code> have here if we don't keep track of
<em>exactly</em> what the value of <code>M</code> and <code>F</code> are?</p>
<p>We'd have to <em>evaluate</em> <code>M</code> to pick up the actual module name, and evaluate <code>F</code>
to know what function to look up, and then look up the actual type of the
function.</p>
<p>If <code>M</code> is anything slightly more complex than just a variable binding like in
the example above, we may just not be able to know what it is. Imagine the
following scenario:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">M = receive Name when is_atom(Name) -&gt; Name end.
M:run().
</code></pre>
<p>We'd need to wait on <em>receiving a message</em> to know what module to look up. This
just isn't plausible because we can't even tell who is sending the message, or
whether a message will be sent at all.</p>
<p>Of course Real World Erlang tends to rely on <code>behaviors</code> to ensure that certain
types are there, so perhaps annotating what the expected module behavior is
would help:</p>
<pre><code class="language-erlang">M : runnable behavior = receive Name when is_atom(Name) -&gt; Name end.
M:run().
</code></pre>
<p>This way we'd be able to analyze this and know what type <code>run</code> should have, or
complain immediately that <code>run</code> isn't actually implemented in that behavior and
thus can't be guaranteed to exist.</p>
<p>Nonetheless this isn't a trivial thing to type-check.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I hope these few things I managed to cover today give you an idea of what are
the hard parts of typing the Erlang language. It is not impossible, in fact
some parts are rather straightforward to type, but its definitely got some
thorny bits that we should address with care.</p>
<p>In the future I'll write more about typing the language, in particular parts
like binary string pattern matching, and the runtime and its properties, such
as hot-code reloading, figuring out process types, and how to check for
type-safe message passing.</p>
<p>Until then, <em>Let it crash!</em></p>
