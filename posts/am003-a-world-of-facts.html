<h1>A Worldview of Facts</h1>
<p>Every representation of reality is built of <em>facts</em>. That's a fact. The fact
that that is a fact, is a fact too.</p>
<p>When you code, you're stating facts of different things. You're saying &quot;this
function recurses over itself&quot;, &quot;this datatype exists&quot;, &quot;this name is bound to
this value&quot;. Programming facts.</p>
<p>But you're also stating facts about information. You're saying &quot;a user exists&quot;,
and more specifically &quot;<em>this user</em> exists&quot;. And when the user provides an
email, you're stating that &quot;<em>this user</em> has <em>this email</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>You build up your worldview by stating these facts.</p>
<p>Lets dig deeper into this, starting from how its typically approached. We'll
then talk about building worldviews more granularly and what the tradeoffs are
there.</p>
<p>Traditional relational database modeling asks us to define up front what
structure and constraints our data will have, and asks us to (mostly) provide
upfront all of the information required to insert or update data. They deal
with entire entities as their choice of granularity.</p>
<p>That is, if we had a user before hand, the above fact would look like an update
to the existing email column. So far so good.</p>
<p>But what happens when we don't actually have a user yet? We typically can't say
anything about records that are not in the database yet. We'd have to create a
user instead. And because we only have the email, and we're forced to say other
things about the users, we'll have to lie about them (use default values, or
allow them to be unset, which is typically a no-no in relational databases).</p>
<p>So traditional relational database modeling forces our hand to deal with
entries in an atomic fashion. Either you create an entire user, or you don't
create one at all. And if you want to say something more, then you have to
alter this agreement you originally had: the database schema.</p>
<p>For the most part our systems will be okay with this. There are however a
number of use-cases where this constraints are crippling our ability to
extract, transform, load data across systems and domains, and turn it from
bits to data, from data to information, and from information to knowledge.</p>
<p>For these use-cases, it can be much harder to collect everything we need to say
about a User and send it all at once. We are then forced to lie. Say that their
name is &quot;&quot; (empty string), for now. Some other system will update it
appropriately.</p>
<p>And yet we no longer know what updated what field to what value, nor when. So
many questions. Audits becomes a lot harder, if not plain impossible.</p>
<p>And if you're exploring a domain, or joining several ones, your database schema
will go through a Kafka-esque migration process. The outcome of which tends to
be to start from scratch. Sometimes this simply isn't an option.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lets look at how things can look when we build up our worldviews in a much more
fine grained manner, through tiny facts about things.</p>
<p>A <em>fact</em> can be thought of as a sentence with a subject, a predicate, and an
object. Sometimes this is called a &quot;semantic triple&quot;, or just triple. For
example: &quot;Alexander Hamilton has email alexander@hamilton.com&quot;.</p>
<p>The structure here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject: Alexander Hamilton</li>
<li>Predicate: has email</li>
<li>Object: alexander@hamilton.com</li>
</ul>
<p>We can state this fact without ever checking if anything has been said before
about the subject (Alexander Hamilton). So in a way, stating this fact is both
updating and creating the subject. We can even state facts about predicates and
objects that we have never seen before and usher them into existence.</p>
<p>This seems to support well the examples we've seen so far, but it requires an
additional level of indirection to support the notions of <em>provenance</em>, who
said what, and <em>temporal causality</em>, when did something happen.</p>
<p>If we wanted to say that the Linn Manuel Miranda said that Alexander Hamilton
has email alexander@hamilton.com on January 20th, 2015, that would look like:</p>
<pre><code>f0 = &quot;Alexander Hamilton has email alxander.hamilton@us.gov&quot;
f1 = &quot;Linn Manuel Miranda said {f0}&quot;
f2 = &quot;{f1} happened on January 20th, 2015&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This nesting is conceptually super clean. Facts about facts, it just makes
sense to allow it. It however has a fundamental problem. Can a user have many
emails? If they can, what does &quot;{user} has email {email}&quot; mean? That they only
have that one, or that they <em>also</em> have that one?</p>
<p>And if we state that same fact 3 times, how many emails does the user have?</p>
<p>Lucky for us, in this example a user has exactly one email.</p>
<p>Unlucky for us, Linn Manuel Miranda has stated more things than this. Which
means that fact &quot;Linn Manuel Miranda said {X}&quot; above would be stated many times
with different X values.</p>
<p>If we see a fact as establishing a relation between two entities, this
introduces the notion of Cardinality of that relation. Can there be zero or
more? one? exactly 5?</p>
<p>It also introduces the notion of symmetric, reflexive, and transitive
relations.If I state a fact, does the fact state me? (symmetry), if the fact is
then used to state another fact, does that mean I stated that fact too?
(transitivity), and does a fact state itself? (reflexivity)</p>
<p>We can leave these topics aside for now, we'll certainly come back to them in
future writings.</p>
<p>To address this, I like to extend the notion of a fact from a triplet, into a
quintuple that requires provenance and temporal elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fact has a subject, referring to whom it affects</li>
<li>A fact has a predicate, describing how the subject and an object relate</li>
<li>A fact has an object, upon which the predicate works</li>
<li>A fact has a source, referring to who or what stated it</li>
<li>A fact happened at a specific time</li>
</ul>
<p>With this 5 things, our above example would read more like</p>
<pre><code>source = &quot;Linn Manuel Miranda&quot;
subject = &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;
predicate = &quot;has email&quot;
object = &quot;alexander.hamilton@us.gov&quot;
time = &quot;January 20th, 2015&quot;

&quot;{source} said that {subject} {predicate} {object} at {time}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is now enough information to keep track of what updated what field to what
value, and when, at all times. If you never delete facts, you essentially have
an audit log:</p>
<ul>
<li>System1 said that User0 is an Admin at T0</li>
<li>System2 said that User1 is an Admin at T1</li>
<li>System1 said that User1 has email &quot;user1@company.com&quot; at T2</li>
<li>System1 said that User3 has email &quot;user2@company.com&quot; at T3</li>
<li>System2 said that User2 has email &quot;user2@company.com&quot; at T4</li>
<li>System2 said that User3 has email &quot;user3@company.com&quot; at T5</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Unfixed Representation</h2>
<p>Something that changes drastically once we start thinking in facts, is that you
no longer have a fixed representation of what is a User like we had in the
traditional relational modeling worldview. You can't pop the hood open and look
at the table columns and now what fields are what, because you could
potentially have new fields all the time, and many fields may never have been
stated before so the database doesn't know about them!</p>
<p>Instead, we have collections of facts stated about a specific User, and we need
to make sense of them. Here is where this process really shines.</p>
<p>Lets call the process of smushing facts for a subject into a single object a
<em>consolidation strategy</em>. This could be &quot;last fact wins&quot; or &quot;depends who said
it&quot;.</p>
<p>If you build systems that work with streams of facts, you can use the
information of any of the facts to decide how consolidate them, depending on
your use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A lookup service may just smush all the facts together into a key-value
store, where multiple facts about the same subject end up reduced into a
single object about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A search service can build appropriate reverse lookup tables to provide fast
results for specific subjects, relations, objects, or even timestamps or
sources. Essentially avoiding consolidation but &quot;inverting facts&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A content moderation service can take into account the provenance of a fact
to decide who has the last word. You can imagine a user trying to mark some
content as deleted, and an admin marking the same content as visible. You'd
expect most of the time for the admin to overrule the user, but perhaps if
you're building</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on and on. In a traditional database you'd be stuck with
whatever representation the owner exposed, typically via an API.</p>
<p>This does not come without tradeoffs, as storing facts can become a challenge
(napkin math: entities of a kind * fields = facts for those entities), and
processing them can be time consuming (imagine processing 2,000,000 facts for a
single entity to essentially &quot;replay&quot; the history of it using a new strategy to
arrive at the current state). I'll leave the engineering details of how to
approach these issues for a different time.</p>
<p>This was an overview showing that granularly building your world view can give
you a lot of flexibility where a traditional modeling approach will not.</p>
<p>That's a fact.</p>
