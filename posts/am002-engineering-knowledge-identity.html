          <h2>AM002</h2>
<h1>Engineering Knowledge: Identity</h1>
<p>I was recently reading the last Software Engineering at Google book by Winters,
Manshreck &amp; Wright, and I really liked the distinction they made between
programming and software engineering.</p>
<p>In short, and without spoiling you a pretty meaty book on the practices,
policies, and tools that make software engineering possible at gargantuan
scale, software engineering is programming over time. If this is making your
head work, go read the book.</p>
<p>What struck me was how I had been working with knowledge systems for a long
time, and I hadn't found a lot out there describing what the differences could
be between one that was merely programmed, and one that was engineered for
changing requirements, to be possible to operate, repair, and adapt with
minimal effort and maximal impact.</p>
<p>Most places I've worked, I've found systems that are just thrown together to
get some data in over HTTP, marshal it into some data structures and off it
goes into a database. The database is likely structured in a strict-ish manner,
with some constraints being set by the schema, such as uniqueness of some keys.
The code that handles the data in and out maybe does some validation of it as
well. You get the picture: the system has information about the information it
processes throughout all its layers.</p>
<p>Now, when the requirements change, we have to go through several layers to make
them work. Validation rules may change when inserting data, so the HTTP layer
must reflect this. But because that is reflected there, the data moved around
to the database doesn't really say anything.  In fact it may need to stay
flexible to support the old data that doesn't pass this validation. Fair
enough.</p>
<p>Other requirement changes, like a field that wasn't supposed to be unique now
being expected to be unique, can involve reprocessing the entirety of the data,
pretty much recreating the database. If you used unique identifiers or
monotonically incremental ones, you may end up redefining the identity of the
data by changing only this requirement. If any systems that depended on this
data held on to the identity of these datum, they'll have to be amended as
well. If these are separate teams or departments, a small constraint change
became an organizational problem.</p>
<p>So lets analyze what would the same core principle of &quot;programming over time&quot;
would be applied to information in a system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Structure</em> of the information will change, be it in storage, transport, or
other canonical representations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Meaning</em> of the information will change, in fact we only know what the data
means now, to the current users and features, but new features could be built
that rely on the same data but treating it so differently that it essentially
means something else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Identity</em> of a piece of information, such as a description of a home in a
real estate market, may be transient and internal, or global and immutable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Provenance</em> of information, or where it came from originally and how can we
backtrack on it to understand its origins and evolution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to cover these in the following weeks.</p>
<p>Today let's talk about Identity.</p>
<p>From an early age we learn to distinguish objects one from the other. In this
process, we assign objects an identity. An abstract, conceptual value that is
associated to only one of them, and can be used to distinguish them apart.
Sometimes this value is concretized in some way: maybe you gave them
pronounceable names, maybe you just kept them very separate from each other, or
maybe you gave them a monotonically increasing identifiers, as some kids do.</p>
<p>Now what happened was that you and only you knew which object was what. Unless
you shared and made very public that Rex was one, and then there's &quot;the other&quot;,
it would be pretty hard for anyone to figure out what you meant. Your
identifiers were local.</p>
<p>In the same way, if you changed your your mind and gave some objects new
identifiers, the old ones went out the window and people would be confused as
to what you are referring to. They'd have to re-learn the new object names.
Your identifiers were transient.</p>
<p>Local, transient identifiers can be incredibly useful, but they are normally
better kept for data that is not shared at all. E.g, I've got 3 guitars at home
and I have names for all of them. Some of the names have changed, no-one has
been affected. So its good to ask yourself in the context of a piece of
information that needs to be identified as separate from a group, who needs to
know about this?</p>
<p>If the answer is more than just &quot;this single system&quot; or &quot;this one component&quot;,
then consider that local, transient identifiers may be useful in the short term
but not scale well over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand of these, we have the ideas of global (as opposed to local)
and immutable (as opposed to transient) identifiers. These are values that
don't really belong to anyone, and they can't change, so we are free to spread
them around freely, even publicly.</p>
<p>So all in, your choice is to either favor locally transient or globally
immutable identification. False dichotomy, of course, since we can come up with
a few hybrids, some better than others (please stay away from globally
transient identification, it will only bring you misery).</p>
<p>Either information inherently belongs to a source of truth (some specific
system's database), or it inherently belongs to nobody, and thus we can build a
single source of truth for it for practical matters.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to think that information either belongs to the organization
building the systems, but no system in particular, or that it is external
information that is actually owned by a 3rd party, even if the organization
building the systems owns the representation of it.</p>
<p>One relatively cheap way of building strong identify for data across our
systems is to start using Uniform Resource Identifiers [see RFC3986], which can
in turn be used as a locator, a name, or both, instead of using incremental
id's or randomized identifiers such as a plain UUID.</p>
<p>Consider a system that stores essays, maybe it is storing this one you are
currently reading, and the ways it could assign id's to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essay with id 002, since its the second I've published</li>
<li>Essay with id 1993388828, because that's how many posts have been made
globally across the entirety of the users</li>
<li>Essay with URI &quot;am:essays:002&quot;, where the namespace &quot;am&quot; stands for Abstract
Machines, and the classifier &quot;essays&quot; tells us this URI points to data of a
certain kind. Lastly &quot;002&quot; is a specific identifier that singles out this
essay from all the other essays under this namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to see how a URI here is vastly more descriptive, and carries around
enough contextual information to speak of not only what it is, but even who
owns it. Many large companies that work with data have opted for using URIs to
globally reference their information. Google, Spotify and LinkedIn are some
examples of this.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a system that works with data using global, immutable
identities has detached ownership of the data from the system, and lifted it to
the abstract machinery composed of the current and future implementation of the
very same systems that process this information.</p>
<p>That's one way in which we can engineer our way to a more resilient data and
information system, so next time you're about to let your database decide what
the identity of something is, consider how will the lifecycle of this identity
be and whether using a URI instead may be more fruitful.</p>
