          <h2>AM001</h2>
<h1>Data Languages</h1>
<p>Whenever I start, join, or pick up a software development project, I'm met with
the question of what information will it process.</p>
<p>Sometimes this information is very small, such as command line flag &quot;-v&quot;
communicating to the program that it should be a tad more verbose than it
usually is. Some other times it is so large that I must assume there's more
information than I can model.</p>
<p>From a single bit flag, to an entire open-world knowledge base, we need to
represent information as data using some language. And whichever data language
we pick, it will make some assumptions that are somewhat appropriate to the
usages it expects of our data.</p>
<h3>When is information validated?</h3>
<p>Many programming languages and frameworks designed and evolved smaller
languages specifically to address the modeling of data. Some of them are done
at runtime, like validation frameworks; some of them are done at compile time,
such as type systems.  For example, Elixir's Ecto lets us define &quot;schemas&quot; from
which to derive &quot;record structs&quot; on which we operate using &quot;changesets&quot;. These
changesets will include runtime validation rules that will prevent us from
creating values that represent valid information unless the validation has
passed entirely.  Another example would be Rust's Clap framework for building
command line tools. It asks you to define a data structure representing your
programs commands, options, and inputs. Around it, a set of meta-programming
constructs that help annotate that structure to generate code that at compile
time will be evaluated to guarantee the information is processed correctly.  
There is a spectrum here.</p>
<h3>Impedance Mismatch between Domain and Host</h3>
<p>In addition, the degree to which the data is &quot;reified&quot; from the language, or
the indirection with which it is represented also varies. Some programs will
let you speak of a piece of information directly, whereas some others would use
a data structure that represents the information. The meaning of the first
would hopefully be encoded in the structure; the meaning of the second will be
encoded in the interpretation of that representation. Some languages will be
better equipped to deal with this than others: e.g, some will provide
constructs to represent data directly that are flexible enough to model your
domain, some others will force workarounds.</p>
<p>For example, a language like Reason or OCaml would let you model inductive
data, such as Natural Numbers, with total elegance, by use of Algebraic Data
Types. Just by looking at a value in its syntactic representation (source
code), we can already tell exactly what kind of data it is, and what we can and
cannot do.</p>
<p>As a counter example, originally Javascript did not have a language that can be
used to define data, and in turn relies on the interpretation of the data as it
runs to determine what is what. It is thus not possible to encode in the
syntactic representation of the program what data is what. Only recently the
language has added new layers of abstraction that allow one to more explicitly
do modeling, but they still rely on the &quot;unstructured&quot; semantics of the core
language.  </p>
<h3>How much more information are we willing to process than we are aware of?</h3>
<p>Lastly, there is the idea that whatever representation of knowledge we have
about the world can be either complete or incomplete. Either we know that this
is all there is, and that if it is not said, it is false, or we know what we
know and what we don't know is simply outside of our knowledge. Understanding
the key philosophical differences of this two positions helps us understand
when some knowledge should be thought of exhaustive, when it shouldn't, and how
to model it in either case.</p>
<p>Asserting that everything that there is to be known is already known and is
modeled within our data language lets us claim that many things are simply
false.</p>
<p>The opposite makes us consider that there will be more information flowing
through our system than there currently is, and thus the system will in itself
be more flexible.</p>
<p>For example, some languages, like SQL, force us to up-front define exactly what
things will be part of our domain model, and encourage a &quot;closed world&quot;
assumption, where if the data is not part of the database, then the
prepositions involving it must be false. Sure, we can learn more about our
domain and try to fit data into it, but the alteration of table to include new
columns simply represents a change in our absolute knowledge. No less data than
we now require can be put in, but neither can more data find a way into that
table. Relational Algebras seem to be bound to exhaustivity.</p>
<p>On the other side we have languages like OWL, or RDF, that base themselves on
the &quot;open world&quot; assumptions: if something isn't known, it just isn't known.
Normally RDF modeling is a much more involved process than stitching together a
few SQL tables with foreign keys, and help involve domain experts too. It
allows us to declare that there are some kinds of data, and to allow
interpretation of data from a variety of projections. Two individuals or
systems may see or ignore entirely disjoint sets of information from the same
data. Adding more data does not mean that the new absolute truth has changed,
but that there is more to be learned. It is a naturally evolving medium.</p>
<p>There is an spectrum here, too.</p>
<hr />
<p>So far I've found that these 3 qualities of data languages make them more or
less suitable for different modeling tasks. A small command line interface may
benefit from a language with a priori verification of close-to-source,
closed-world information modeling such as boolean flags. A system processing
information from several news sources may need a much larger notion of
validity, perhaps even several ones that are closer to whoever consumes the
information, and thus several projections of the same information may come at
play.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that the extremes in this space are particularly more
useful than any middle ground, but I'm entertaining the idea that a statically
verified language with first-class constructs for modeling information under an
open-world assumption could be very useful in the industry today, and tomorrow.</p>
